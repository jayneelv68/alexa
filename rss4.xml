      “Who knows in ten or twenty years some Indian player might sign a professional contract with Bayern Munich,” these were the words of former World Cup winner Bixente Lizarazu, who was in Delhi to promote the FC Bayern Youth Cup.

However, he was quick to point out that the Indian kids first need to get themselves to the level of the Bayern Munich academy footballers to help their cause. “At this moment the European youngsters are ahead of the Indians because they are getting better training and grooming facilities but there’s no reason why Indians can’t reach that level. Proper planning needs to be in place,” the former France footballer said.
