      After two successful seasons at the club, Spaniard Albert Roca has decided to part ways with Bengaluru FC, a decision that left many lost for words.

Roca has been one of the top managers in the country over the last two seasons, guiding Bengaluru FC to four finals, out of which they won two titles -- the Federation Cup in 2017 and the Super Cup in 2018.
