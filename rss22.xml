      BJP candidate Bharati Ghosh, a former IPS officer and once a trusted lieutenant of West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee, was in tears Sunday morning after she was attacked, heckled and pushed to the ground at a polling station as the state votes in the sixth round of the national election. Ms Ghosh is the BJP candidate in Bengal's Ghatal Lok Sabha constituency. The village of Keshpur in Ghatal, 145 km from Kolkata, turned into a battlefield on Sunday with supporters of the ruling Trinamool Congress heckling, surrounding and finally giving chase to the BJP candidate who took shelter in a temple. "Keshpur has become Kashmir today. The police compelled me to get out of my car in front of an angry mob. The administration wanted to have me killed. There is massive rigging in Midnapore," Bharati Ghosh said. Trouble started early in the day but peaked around noon when the Keshpur Bazar area turned into the site of violence with Trinamool supporters, in their hundreds, throwing stones at Bharati Ghosh's car, at the police, at the media and causing a total lockdown in the area.
