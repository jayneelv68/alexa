      <title>Communicating Transition from Prototyping to Production

      Another way to mitigate risk is clear communication when transferring designs to production status. 
      Since prototype and/or pre-production controls are often not as strict as controls on production-level product, it is critical for the OEM to clearly communicate to the supplier the point in time at which production-level process controls are required. 
      Failure to communicate this requirement could result in changes made to the process without adequate review and approval.
